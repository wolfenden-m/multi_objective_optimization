      "The underperformance of **MOPSO-CD** in the suitcase example problem likely stems from its reliance on **crowding distance** to maintain diversity in the Pareto front. If the suitcase problem involves **highly constrained or discontinuous objective spaces** (e.g., strict capacity limits, non-linear trade-offs between objectives), MOPSO-CD's crowding distance metric may struggle to balance exploration and exploitation effectively. Additionally, if the problem's optimal solutions cluster in narrow regions of the search space, the **lack of adaptive mutation** in MOPSO-CD could hinder its ability to refine solutions in those areas.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### When MOPSO-CD Might Outperform Others:\n",
      "1. **Diverse Pareto Fronts**: Problems requiring a **spread-out set of solutions** (e.g., multi-mode optimization) where crowding distance ensures good coverage.\n",
      "2. **Low-Dimensional, Smooth Landscapes**: When objectives are **moderately conflicting** and the search space is not dominated by local optima.\n",
      "3. **Computationally Lightweight Needs**: If rapid convergence to a near-optimal set is prioritized over fine-grained precision (e.g., preliminary design exploration).\n",
      "4. **Problems with Connected Pareto Fronts**: Where the true Pareto front is continuous and convex, allowing crowding distance to effectively preserve diversity.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- For the suitcase problem, consider hybridizing MOPSO-CD with **local search operators** or adjusting its **mutation rate** to better handle constraints.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Workflow**:\n",
      "   - **Step 1**: Define experience tiers (e.g., senior, mid-level, junior) and associated salary ranges.\n",
      "   - **Step 2**: Use linear programming or MOO frameworks (e.g., NSGA-II) to model trade-offs.\n",
      "   - **Step 3**: Test hybrid teams (e.g., 3 senior + 2 mid-level + 1 junior) to optimize for your preference weights.\n",
      "   - **Step 4**: Iterate by adjusting weights or constraints (e.g., \"maximize experience while keeping payroll ≤ X\").\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example**: If senior hires cost 50% more than mid-level but provide 30% more experience, a mixed team might offer better ROI than all-senior hires. You could also explore cross-training junior employees to bridge gaps.\n"
